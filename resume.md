## Experience

### Data Engineer, [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com); RTP, NC, USA --- 2021-Present

Building a log/file aggregator with the capability of dumping the aggregated logs to a single file basing on different log levels/keywords or forwarding them as an email to the concerned with simple mail setup configuration along with a scheduler to automate the same.

_Leveraging **LLMs** for summary generation_

Built a network security _threat analytics_ system involving scheduled multiple data transfers between different systems along with statistics based analytics system resulting in threat and compromise identification and subscriber segmentation.

- Scheduled and automated transfer of data between varied systems including on-premises and cloud
- Built the Statistical Analytics module for identifying threats and indicating compromises
- Leveraged upon MLFlow open-source python package for maintaining and visualising analytics process logs
- Integrated the system with Cisco's SecureX platform

_Built a customised (loosely coupled) **K-means** module along with the data transformations around it_

### Data Engineer, [84.51<sup>o</sup>](https://www.8451.com); Cincinnati, OH, USA --- 2020-2021

Built an automated system around a _data science_ model that fetches data from multiple sources, aggregates, transforms, fed to the model for prediction and the resulting data is written on to the target location.

- Developed the workflows using Python and Airflow
- Developed the data jobs using Pyspark

_Executes **20 billion rows** with **20 columns** and **40 steps** of transformation in about **23 mins**_

### Data Engineer, [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com); Bengaluru, KA, IND --- 2019-2020

Automated data pipelines involving data transformations and migrations between various storage services

- Smartsheet to Hadoop (on GCP)
- Hadoop (on GCP) to Snowflake
- Hadoop (on GCP) to Hadoop (on GCP)

_Each script executes **twice weekly** handling incremental updates_

### NLP Engineer, [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com); Bengaluru, KA, IND --- 2019-2020

Developed a chatbot that interacts with the user as first point of contact and transfers the conversation to a specific bot (with the context) for the specific resolution.

_Implemented **context transfers** between the bots_

### Consultant, [Talent Sprint](https://talentsprint.com); Hyderabad, TG, IND --- 2018-2019

Developed and deployed a _data science model_ that suggests the optimized arguments for the execution parameters of the task at hand.

### Software Engineer, [Global Data](https://www.globaldata.com); Hyderabad, TG, IND --- 2018-2018

Automated 2 data pipelines involving extraction of data from multiple sources including **HTML and XML pages & HTTP and FTP** servers and loading onto **on-prem SQL Servers** after required cleanings and transformations.

_Implemented **changing proxies** and leveraged on **multi-processing** execution and runs **thrice weekly** on multiple machines_

### Software Developer, [Invincible Software Solutions Integrated](http://www.issi-india.com); Visakhapatnam, AP, IND --- 2017-2018

Developed **Backend and Database** for **12** web applications. Built descriptively analyzed data visualization reports using **Tableau** (& **SSRS**) for _USA_ based _federal_ clients.

### Project Engineer, [Royal Oman Police](https://www.rop.gov.om/english/index.html); Muscat, OM --- 2013-2015

Designed and developed database for Speed Cameras and developed _automated transfer of data_ from the _primary (OLTP)_ servers to _secondary (OLAP)_ servers.

### Automation Engineer, [Mott MacDonald](https://www.mottmac.com); Abu Dhabi, UAE --- 2009-2012

- Implemented automation multi-threaded document pooling using string search across systems from different geographies
- Automated emails sends to a list of email address with the above found documents as attachments
